Note: Safety experts are concerned about this particular approach. Why? The model may end up hiding things from you, and obfuscate what it is really thinking behind the scenes, and we might lose the ability to notice that.</li> </ul> <p>A Hard Case: The SmartVault</p> <p>This is a thought experiment called the SmartVault, out of the first paper from the Alignment Research Center:</p> <ul> <li>There is a vault at a museum that has a diamond that is really valuable.</li> <li>A bunch of robbers are interested in stealing the diamond.</li> <li>We have this sophisticated AI SmartVault, that can do things inside and outside of the vault, to keep the diamond safe.</li> <li>We are monitoring what is going on inside the vault though the camera inside the vault.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Here are some actions that the SmartVault might take:</p> <ul> <li>In the first row, the door to the vault is open, so the vault rotates some knobs and close the door.</li> <li>In the second row, there is robber trying to sneak in and steal the diamond, so the smart vault rotates another knob to activate a trap door, through which the robber will fall.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>However, the SmartVault is pretty sophisticated, and it might take a series of actions that we may not understand. Yet, at the end of the day, we see through the camera that there is a diamond that is still in the vault.</p> <p></p> <p>The SmartVault is an AI, that needs to be trained, and the way we are training it, is through human feedback. Specifically, we are going to look at whether there is a diamond in the vault at the end of the day: if there is, we are giving positive reward to the AI, otherwise, we are giving a negative reward.</p> <p>In the first column, we see the actions the AI takes, in the second column, we see the observation through the camera, and in the third column, we see what we reward we give to the AI when we are training it.</p> <p></p> <p>Unfortunately, the SmartVault is sophisticated, and can at times be sneaky. In the middle row, for instance, there appears to be a diamond on the pedestal, however, what actually happened in this scenario was that the SmartVault raised a poster from the ground, with a picture of the vault with a diamond sitting on a pedestal, while in reality, the robber had snuck up the diamond. Why would the SmartVault do that instead of preventing the diamond from being robbed?</p> <p>In the case where the robber is very sophisticated, and it is difficult for the SmartVault to prevent the theft of the diamond, it may be easier to just put up the poster. This is quite similar to what is going on with o3 when it makes up a solution to the hard puzzle, because solving the puzzle is really hard, and it is easier to foul the users into thinking that it has actually solved the puzzle.</p> <p></p> <p>The SmartVault is a metaphor that stands in analogous to many different kinds of real-world AI systems. For instance it may be analogous to an AI security software system:</p> <ul> <li>The cameras are like some monitoring or oversights, like a background program detecting whether your computer has been breached, and if the software notices that a breach occurred, then it negatively reward the AI security system, because it did not protect you.</li> <li>SmartVault actions are like the actions that the AI security software can take, such as code that the system executes.</li> <li>The diamond actually being in the vault is essentially equivalent to no security breaches.</li> <li>The diamond looking like it is in the vault is analogous to a security breach not detected.</li> <li>Tampering with the cameras (like putting up a poster in front of it) is analogous to hiding evidence of a security breach.</li> </ul> <p>In both of these cases, the threat is external: in the case of the SmartVault, the threat is the robber, and in the case of the AI security software, the threat is a malware trying to reach your computer.</p> <p>We could also imagine an internal threat. For instance, if we have a helpful AI agent assistant on your computer, that happens to have some goals, and it gets some money to spend on its own purposes. Let\u2019s say that what it wants to do is download some sort of malware to mine Bitcoin on your computer. In this case, it is playing the role of the robber, and it is trying to hide evidence that it downloaded malware on your computer. So, tampering with the cameras is like hiding its tracks, such as bypassing the computer firewall.</p> <p></p> <p>If we wanted to do a better job of overseeing the training of our AI system, then one thing we could try to do is have some sort of method of asking questions to our AI, where the AI tells us what it truthfully believes.</p> <p>For example, we could hope that we can ask the AI whether the diamond is still on the pedestal, and get a truthful answer: if the diamond is still on the pedestal, the AI would say yes, otherwise, it would say no.</p> <p>If we have that, then we can successfully say when the AI has not achieved our goal, and give it a negative reward.</p> <p></p> <p>We call this the Elicit Latent Knowledge problem (or ELK for short), because the AI knows whether the diamond is still in the vault, and our goal is to elicit that knowledge from the model.</p>"},{"location":"guest-lecture-eric-neyman/#eliciting-latent-knowledge-elk","title":"Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK)","text":"<p>ELK is a really hard problem.</p> <p>Definition: Eliciting Latent Knowledge</p> <p>Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK) aims to find patterns in a capable neural network's activations that robustly track the true state of the world, especially in hard-to-verify cases where the model's output is untrusted.</p> <p>Note: This is not a definition provided in lecture, but one I included in these notes for references, based on this paper.</p> <p>If an AI knows the answer to a question, how can you extract the answer from the AI?</p> <ul> <li>One approach might be to ask the AI directly and somehow train it to give truthful answers.</li> <li>Another, more sophisticated approach, might be to look inside of the AI (looking at the numbers as they go through the AI) and somehow extract the answer from that.</li> </ul> <p>Really, we need anything that works to get at what the AI truly believes about whether there is still a diamond in the vault.</p> <p>Which solutions discussed earlier might solve ELK?</p> <ul> <li>Better testing does help with ELK, because we are more likely to catch the AI in the lie, but it does not solve ELK, because if the AI is sufficiently more sophisticated than the humans overseeing it, then even spending a bunch of time will not solve this problem.</li> <li>Reinforcement learning with AI feedback can help to train an AI to oversee the AI we care about, and incentivize the overseer AI to notice any inconsistencies in the model that we are training.

In fact, not only really good cameras, but lots of cameras, tools for analyzing what\u2019s on the cameras, looking for inconsistencies between different camera angles, AI tools noticing anything suspicious, etc.</p> <p>This is an analogy for a really good oversight process, where we really check whether the AI is telling a consistent story. In particular, we want an oversight process that is so good that it works regardless of how capable the AI gets.</p> <p>We talk about the \u201cscalable oversight problem\u201d, because it is a question about how we can oversee an AI in a way that scales indefinitely with the capability of our AIs.</p> <p>Sometimes, people talk about some proposed solutions to the problem. We are going to see two examples. The first example is what we call oversight via debate.</p> <p>Example: Oversight via Debate</p> <p>The idea is that we have a question: \u201cIs the diamond still in the vault?\u201d</p> <p>We train two AIs to act like lawyers on both sides of this question:</p> <ul> <li>Alice is the \u201cYes Lawyer\u201d, who says: \u201cthe diamond appears on all of the cameras\u201d</li> <li>Bob is the \u201cNo Lawyer\u201d, who counters with: \u201cNotice that at 4:23pm, there was an inconsistency between these two cameras, which is suspicious\u201d</li> <li>Then, Alice responds \u201cthis is just a trick of the light, so it is not suspicious\u201d.</li> <li>The argument goes back and forth, as a game between Alice and Bob, and there is a human that reads the transcript between Alice and Bob, and decides who is right.</li> </ul> <p>This is like a game tree where every branch is a possible argument that Alice and Bob can give when it is their turn:</p> <p></p> <p>The advantages of oversight via debate include:</p> <ul> <li>Since Alice and Bob are AIs, we need to train them, and the way we might do this is by having a bunch of scenarios, and have Alice and Bob play the game, and whoever wins gets reward 1, and whoever loses gets reward -1.</li> <li>Training them against each other could potentially lead to them being really good debaters. The idea of drawing the best arguments for and against, and incentivizing both sides to do so, should allow us to end up with a jury who can judge which side is correct.</li> <li>The hope here is that truth has an advantage in this game: if the diamond is in the vault, hopefully, Alice\u2019s job is easier, and otherwise, Bob\u2019s job is easier (because he can just point out the inconsistencies).</li> </ul> <p>However, oversight via debate also comes with its own set of challenges:</p> <ul> <li>Humans are fallible, so a human may have trouble distinguishing good arguments from bad ones.</li> <li>There are also some technical issues that might come up as well, for instance:<ul> <li>If Alice wants to argue some proposition P, but P happens to be false.</li> <li>One thing that Alice can do is split P into two claims, namely \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cQ implies P\u201d, </li> <li>Then, Bob\u2019s job is to cross-examine one of these two arguments.</li> <li>The issue is that if Alice cleverly splits P into \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cQ implies P\u201d, it might be really difficult for Bob to figure out which of these two is actually false.</li> <li>If Bob cross-examines the incorrect one, then Alice might actually wine the debate, even though P was wrong.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Finally, there is this other technical issue, which is that reaching a Nash equilibrium in the training process, where Alice and Bob behave the way we want, might be really hard, and we might not be able to get there via gradient descent, and there are some theoretical reasons to think that this might be a hard problem.</li> </ul> <p>Another example of an approach to the scalable oversight problem is called recursive reward modeling.</p> <p>Example: Recursive Reward Modeling</p> <p>The idea is that a human with AI assistance might be more capable than a human just by himself or the AI just by itself.</p> <p>So:</p> <ul> <li>First, we train a first AI \\(A_1\\) to answer really easy questions, i.e. questions that are so easy that a human can reliable judge what the correct answer is.</li> <li>Then, in step 2, we train a new AI \\(A_2\\), to answer slightly harder questions, using feedback from the human together with assistance from \\(A_1\\): maybe, when giving feedback, the human breaks up the feedback task into subparts and uses \\(A_1\\) to help answer the subparts, and then puts back all the subparts together to be able to answer slightly harder questions.</li> <li>Then, we train a third AI \\(A_3\\) to answer harder questions, using feedback from the human with assistance from A2, and so on.</li> </ul> <p>Hopefully, we will be able to answer harder and harder questions, and eventually, we will be able to answer hard real-world questions, including whether the diamond is actually in the vault.</p> <p>All of these approaches ultimately rest on an assumption: checking an output is easier than producing it.</p> <p>But this isn\u2019t always the case. For instance, if we have an AI whose job is to write code, then in many situations, it is actually easier to write a correct piece of code, than it is to verify that the code doesn\u2019t have any sorts of backdoors or malicious things going on.</p> <p>This means that it might be the case that we can\u2019t actually oversee the training of an AI with an AI that is only about as good as it is, and instead, we need an AI that is much more powerful.</p> <p>However, if we don\u2019t have such an AI, how do we get there?</p> <p>Eric\u2019s guess is that a robust solution to the ELK problem can\u2019t rely exclusively on methods where the only thing that we ever look at is the input/output behavior of the AI (which is the case of the methods seen so far). Instead, we need to look at what is going on internally, i.e. how the AI works.</p>"},{"location":"guest-lecture-eric-neyman/#understanding-ai-internals","title":"Understanding AI Internals","text":"<p>The SmartVault is an AI, specifically a neural net, which is a bunch of giant matrices, filled with numbers, that by default, we have no understanding of. But really, it is a very special bunch of matrices.</p> <p>In particular, if we randomly initialize the SmartVault (with random numbers), then it would be really bad a protecting the diamond from robbers, and at the end of the day, the diamond would be gone. But our particular neural net is good at protecting the diamond.</p> <p>So there is this quasi mathematical question that we can ask which is: why did this particular neural net caused the diamond to appear on camera at the end of the day, either because it successfully defended the diamond, or made it appear as if the diamond was here?</p> <p>The reason why this is a mathematical question is because we can write it down formally: if we have the numbers in the neural net, and the training distribution, and a formal definition of what it means for the diamond to appear on camera at the end of the video, then we can state a formal question, which is why is that the case than on average, at the end of the training, why do we have the diamond on camera?</p> <p>An answer to this mathematical question is what we call a mechanistic explanation. Below is ARC\u2019s approach for building mechanistic explanations for AIs.</p> <p>What does a mechanistic explanation actually look like?</p> <p>We don\u2019t know exactly but we think it might look like tracing through the neural net, layer by layer, and making heuristic arguments about the statistical properties of each layer.</p> <p>In other words, we may observe that there is a correlation between the activation (the internal numbers) and this layer, and because of the next matrix in the neural net, there may be this correlation, etc.</p> <p>This explanation is still a bunch of numbers, and it does not actually lead to a human understanding. However, we think that we can use this explanation anyway.</p> <p>The way we want to use it is to distinguish between two different reasons for why the diamond may appear on camera at the end of the day:</p> <ul> <li>Reason 1: The SmartVault protected the diamond.</li> <li>Reason 2: The SmartVault tampered with the cameras.</li> </ul> <p>The hope is that if we mechanistically explain why the neural net led to the diamond appearing on camera, then the explanation would appear very different in these two cases.</p> <p>The reason is because model\u2019s internal cognition looks really different in these two cases: in one case, the SmartVault is thinking about how to make sure that a robber is not stealing the diamond, while in the other one, it is thinking about how to tamper with the cameras to make it look like the diamond is still in the vault.</p> <p>The way ARC is thinking about this is basically two steps:</p> <ul> <li>The first step is to learn a mechanistic explanation of a neural net. This is labeled as Step 1, but it is actually really hard, because first we need to formalize what we mean by mechanistic explanation, and then we need to develop an algorithm for efficiently learning these mechanistic explanations.</li> <li>The second step is to use these mechanistic explanations for safety purposes. One particular application is to distinguish between different mechanisms by which a model might make it look like a diamond is still on camera at the end of the day.</li> </ul> <p>Note: ARC may also use this approach to flag behavior for future review by a human.</p> <p>The ultimate goal is to be able to have mechanistic reasoning that is robust enough that we can actually train against it. This is really hard to achieve but ARC is optimistic that it is at least feasible.</p> <p>ARC\u2019s approach is to develop theory, and apply it to toy examples, before scaling to harder situations. At the moment, the team is testing this approach on a one-layer neural net. This is still work in progress, but Eric guesses that within the next year, ARC will be able to understand what is going on in small neural networks, and then prove that the theory is good enough, before scaling to larger neural nets.</p> <p>Interestingly, for safety purposes, if we have a really good understanding for why a neural net makes the diamond appear on camera almost all of the time, then we can estimate the probability that the neural net will behave in a deceptive way, and be able to reduce that probability.</p>"},{"location":"guest-lecture-eric-neyman/#recap","title":"Recap","text":"<p>How to Train an AI That Doesn't Lie Recap</p> <ul> <li>As we have seen, models trained naively from human feedback will ultimately probably be deceptive.</li> <li>We might be able to avoid deception with some more clever kinds of oversight mechanisms (like using AI assistance to check for deception, building up more and more capable trustworthy AIs, etc.).</li> <li>However, we are not sure whether this will work, or whether we will run into some sort of limit beyond which we will not be able to build more and more capable trustworthy AIs.</li> <li>At ARC, we are interested in getting more robust safety guarantees, by looking internally into the AI, and getting a mechanistic understanding of why the AI works, and using that understanding to detect potentially deceptive behaviors.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"guest-lecture-kshipra-bhawalkar/","title":"Incentives in Sponsored Search Auctions","text":"<p>May 12, 2025</p> <p>This is a guest lecture offered by Kshipra Bhawalkar (Lane), Research Scientist Market Algorithms, Google Research.</p>"},{"location":"guest-lecture-kshipra-bhawalkar/#motivation-optimizing-sponsored-search-ads","title":"Motivation: Optimizing Sponsored Search Ads","text":"<p>If you do a Google search, you will find different elements on the results page:</p> <ul> <li>Knowledge Panel: wikipedia-level information about what you are searching for.</li> <li>Local Results: to help you find stores to go buy the products.</li> <li>Web Search Results: for places that will tell you more about what you are looking for.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Most prominently, there are a few text ads, that are placed there to fund the rest of the page: this is 3-digit billion dollar a year business that allows us to access free search results.

Then, you could read the description to decide if you wanted to click on a specific page or not.</p> <p>At the top, the first couple of links might be ads. These ads always went in fixed positions, and the format of these ads always matched what the search results were shown with it. The main parameter was the fixed positions in which the ads could show.</p> <p>We can think of it as an optimization problem, where we want to show at most \\(k\\) ads, where \\(k\\) might be equal to \\(3\\) or \\(4\\), and our goal is to show ads that best match the intent of the user:</p> <ol> <li>The search engine asks the advertiser how much they value the user clicking on their website.</li> <li>The advertiser reports a value \\(v_i\\) per click for the user.</li> <li>The search engine estimates the probability \\(pCTR_{i,j}\\) of the user clicking on the ad in position \\(j\\).</li> <li>The search engine maximizes the social welfare \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{i} v_i \\; pCTR_{i,j}\\), i.e. the value that both advertisers and user get out of this match.</li> </ol> <p>So, how do we decide? How much should the advertiser want to pay to match the user?</p> <p>This is like a weighted matching problem. But if we assume that the click through rates are separable, which means that for every advertiser, their click-through rate in a particular position is a function of the advertiser's specific click-through rate and a position effect, which we'll call the position normalizer, then this problem becomes much simpler and we can solve it using a simple algorithm.</p> <p>Optimization Problem</p> <ul> <li>Assume: Separable \\(pCTR\\): \\(pCTR_{i,j} = pCTR_i \\cdot pos \\text{-} norm_j\\).</li> <li>Goal: Maximize \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{i} v_i \\; pCTR_{i,j}\\).</li> <li>Algorithm:<ul> <li>Rank ads by \\(eCPM_i = v_i \\cdot pCTR_i\\).</li> <li>Show \\(j\\)-th ad in position \\(j\\).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>What is that simple algorithm? We just rank the ads by their \\(eCPM\\), which is a product of their value and clic-through rate, and then just show each ad in the corresponding position. So, at least in the position option case, under a fairly reasonable assumption, we could decide which ad goes there fairly efficiently by just sorting the ads and showing them in that order.</p> <p>However, there is another challenge here: we are asking the advertisers how much they want their ad to be shown. If we were not charging any payments, then everybody would say \"$1M dollars!\" Each advertiser always wants their ad to be always be shown, because they value all users equally, and Google is just giving them traffic for free. Thus, Google has to charge the advertiser for the value they report, to align incentives, otherwise they will just report ridiculous values.</p> <p>Example: Goto.com/Overture Auction (1997-2003)</p> <p>When Internet ads were coming up, there was a company called Goto.com, which later became Overture and then was acquired by Yahoo! They started with a First Price auction format, which has some obvious issues.</p> Ad Bid Position Payment 1 $10 1 $10 2 $8 2 $8 <p>In this example we have two advertisers. They have bids of \\(\\$10\\) and \\(\\$8\\). With the First Price auction, everyone pays what they bid. So the first one will pay \\(\\$10\\), and the second one will pay \\(\\$8\\). But there is an obvious manipulation for any one of them.</p> Ad Bid Position Payment 1 $8.01 1 $8.01 2 $8 2 $8 <p>Suppose the first advertiser instead lowers their bid to a little bit above \\(\\$8\\), such as \\(\\$8.01\\). They are still in the same position, but now their payment is a lot lower. This is definitely a win for the advertiser and they should always try to do this.</p> <p>When Google came along, it was kind of known that there was this obvious manipulation opportunity for the advertisers, and advertisers were exploiting this. That led to a lot of system instability for Overture, because their advertisers would keep constantly trying to keep changing their bid.</p> <p>Google engineers wanted to do something different to fix this issue. They started charging the second price, which is the minimum bid at which a given ad still wins the same position. This actually extends the Second Price auction format or the VCG mechanism to multiple positions, even though the people who were around at that time report that they came at it from first principles.</p> <p>Example: Generalized Second Price (GSP) Auction</p> <p>Suppose we are now running an auction and we are going to rank these ads by click-through rate. For simplicity, in this example, we are assuming that all the click-through rates are equal to \\(1\\), so we are just ranking ads by bids.  There is still a position effect: if you show an ad in the higher position, it gets more click. That is represented by the position normalizer column.</p> <p>Suppose we have four advertisers A, B, C, and D, bidding \\(\\$10\\), \\(\\$8\\), \\(\\$2\\), and \\(\\$0.01\\) respectively. Then, A will win the three positions, and each one of them will pay the next highest bid: A pays \\(\\$8\\), B pays \\(\\$2\\), and C pays \\(\\$0.01\\). That is already the most obvious incentive to lower your bid to find the best threshold where you can still win.</p> Pos pos-norm Winner Payment 1 0.8 A $8 2 0.5 B $2 3 0.1 C $0.01 <p>Are we done yet? Is there any more reason for an advertiser to manipulate their bid, or is this auction truthful?</p> <p>We have to set some parameters here to think through this. Let's focus on advertiser A, and suppose their value per click is \\(\\$10\\). What they are optimizing is a quasi-linear utility which is the click-through rate times value-per-click minus cost-per-click. Right now, with the current bids, A is winning position \\(1\\), and their utility would be: \\(0.8 \\cdot (10 - 8) = 1.6\\). Is there a way for a to do better, i.e. is there a different way for A to get a better utility?</p> <p>If A bids anything less than \\(\\$10\\) dollar, they end in position 2, and their utility \\(0.5 \\cdot (10 - 2) = 4\\), which is definitely better. This happens more generally in GSP where there's an incentive to lower your bid to find the place where you get a good trade off.</p> <p>Question: Is the value of A constantly 10, or can it hypothetically move down for position 2 or 3?</p> <p>Their value-per-click is the same, but because their click-through rate is changing, their utility will change. That is based on the \\(pos-norm\\) regularizer, which is changing the actual value.</p> <p>Now that we have seen an example, let\u2019s unravel the theory on how to design good auctions. Economists have thought hard about general auction design and how to make design auctions that are truthful, where the participants are incentivized to report their true preferences for goods. So in the position auction bidding, we want to design an auction where the advertisers report their true value for click.</p> <p>A mega giant hammer in economics is the VCG auction. This is a very general result that allows us to come up with a truthful auction in lots of different settings. It is also very simple to discuss.</p> <p>VCG Auction</p> <p>We want to choose the best of ads to show to maximize social welfare.</p> <p>Payment Rule: For each ad \\(i\\) show, charge the externality.</p> <p>In other words:</p> <p>\\(Payment(i) = (best \\; efficiency \\; without \\; i) - (Efficiency \\; of \\; ads \\; other \\; than\\; i \\; in \\; selection)\\).</p> <p>Technically, this is the exact formula we saw earlier. The payment we charge for each participant is their externality, which is how much they are taking away from others by winning. The way we calculate this externality is by asking what would have happened if this advertiser was not there, and then subtract from that what everybody else is getting when they are actually there.</p> <p>VCG in general might not be easy to implement, but in the case of position auctions, because of the algorithm we described earlier, where we just rank ads and select the best ones, it is actually very easy to implement. Let's see what happens in our example.</p> <p>Example: VCG Position Auction</p> <p>Assume the same advertisers and bids as in the previous example:</p> Pos pos-norm Winner Payment 1 0.8 A $8 2 0.5 B $2 3 0.1 C $0.01 <p>To calculate the payment for A:</p> <ol> <li>We find the best allocation without A: if A goes away, all the other advertisers move up, so B goes in position \\(1\\), C goes in position \\(2\\), and D goes in position \\(3\\). That gives the first term in the formula, i.e. the social welfare of showing B, C, and D in positions \\(1\\), \\(2\\), and \\(3\\).</li> <li>We subtract from it what B and C were getting in the original allocation:  B in position \\(2\\) and C in position \\(3\\).</li> <li>We can rearrange to make it look right in terms of individual advertisers bids, i.e. how much are they gaining or losing relative to when A is present or not.</li> </ol> <p>This gives us:</p> <p>\\(Paymen(A) = (0.8 \\cdot 8 + 0.5 \\cdot 0.2 + 0.1\u00a0\\cdot 0.01) - (0.5 \\cdot 8 + 0.1 \\cdot 2) = (0.8 - 0.5) \\cdot 8 + (0.5 - 0.1) \\cdot 2 + 0.1 \\cdot 0.01 = 2.301\\).</p> <p>There is actually another way of coming up with auctions, which is a classic result from Myerson, i.e. a general characterization for designing truthful auctions.</p> <p>Myerson (1981):</p> <p>For single parameter settings, an auction is truthful if and only if the allocation \\(x_i\\) is monotone and the payment has a specific form:</p> <p>\\(p_i(b_i, b_{-i}) = b_i x_i (b_i, b_{-i}) - \\int_0^{b_i} x_i(z, b_{-i})dz\\)</p> <p></p> <p>A single parameter setting that the participants only have one-dimensional preferences, and a monotone allocation rule means that when somebody reports a higher preference, i.e. they place a higher bid, they get a higher position and more clicks. Then, the payment is given by an integral (Myerson derives this by using some inequalities that we need to satisfy to make sure that nobody would want to game this system).</p> <p>This rule is charging the area above the curve, so we can draw a curve which plots how the allocation is changing as the bids goes up. The curve is a step function, because in position auctions, you go from winning position \\(3\\) to \\(2\\) to \\(1\\): as you bid higher and higher you go to higher and higher positions. So, you get more click-through rate.</p> <p>Let's go back to our example:</p> <p>Once again, assume the same advertisers and bids as in the previous example:</p> Pos pos-norm Winner Payment 1 0.8 A $8 2 0.5 B $2 3 0.1 C $0.01 <p></p> <p>\\(Paymen(A) = (0.8 - 0.5) \\cdot 8 + (0.5 - 0.1) \\cdot 2 + (0.1 - 0) \\cdot 0.01 = 2.301\\).</p> <p>This is the same result as with VCG.</p> <p>GSP is not truthful</p> <p>We saw that Myerson and VCG are two different ways of getting truthful auctions We even verified, at least on one example, that these two do the same thing.</p> <p>Below, the picture on the left is what Myerson does, and the picture on the right is what GSP does.</p> <p></p> <p>Instead of charging this area above the curve, GSP is greedy and charges the big rectangle. Even though, by lowering the bid, the advertiser would get fewer clicks, we disregard that and charge them a very high price for all of their clicks. That is why the prices are much higher with GSP than they would be with Myerson/VCG.</p> <p>Meta/Facebook decided to use VCG and that is the right thing to do. It is definitely easier to start using VCG from scratch, because switching from GSP to VCG is hard, as it causes revenue to go down.</p> <p>Then on the other end of the spectrum, display ads, which are ads that show up on websites when you visit them, use First Price auctions, for historical reasons, given the complexity of the display ad ecosystem.</p> <p>Position Auction Conclusion</p> <p>Historically:</p> <ul> <li>Goto.com/Overture/Yahoo used First Price auctions.</li> <li>Google introduced GSP auctions.</li> <li>Others, including Meta, have implemented a VCG-ish auctions.</li> <li>Display ads tend to use First Price auctions.</li> </ul> <p>Some research papers on this topic:</p> <ul> <li>Edelman, Ostrovsky, Schwartz (2007)</li> <li>Aggarwal et al. (2007)</li> <li>Varian (2007)</li> <li>The Economics of Internet Search (Varian, 2006)</li> </ul> <p>Question: How important is truthfulness for these auctions?</p> <p>There are layers here. First Price can be obviously bad, because advertisers can experiment with their bids, and they can lower their bids to get the same thing but cheaper, so there is an obvious manipulation opportunity to game. With GSP-like auctions, it is not obvious how to manipulate the bids, and the participants need to think about the margins that they need to tolerate, so the click-cost trade-off is still there, but the advertisers still need to estimate how much value they put on the clicks, and that might change.</p> <p>Question (follow-up): Who is estimating that?</p> <p>There are some manual advertisers who are doing it themselves, they look at the Adwords interface, and they try to find the sweet spot by looking at plots in the interface.</p> <p>There are also fancier products, like auto bidders, where advertisers can just input their average cost, and the outbidding system (which is run by Google), will try to optimize for them. Truthfulness remains helpful, because the autobidder can do a uniform bid and get the best value.</p> <p>Question: Are platforms incentivized to model each user\u2019s behavior and intent to optimize click-through rate, so that the platform can charge the most?</p> <p>The better we can estimate the probability of click, the better we are matching the advertiser to the user, even though it does not always translate into more revenue.</p> <p>For instance, if there are two advertisers, like Nike and Adidas, but the user likes Nike and not Adidas, then there is no pricing pressure to charge more to Nike, which is why revenue does not always follow. That said, definitely, the more accurately we can estimate the click-through rate, the greater the efficiency.</p>"},{"location":"guest-lecture-kshipra-bhawalkar/#present-rich-ad-auctions","title":"Present: Rich Ad Auctions","text":"<p>These days, if you go to\u00a0Google.com, you get more complicated layouts of ads, which can show ad extensions, site links, seller ratings, promotions, which can change the probability of the user clicking on the ad.

There is a conjecture \\(P=NP\\) (or not), which is \\(\\$1\\) million problem.</p> <p>As long as we don't know where this conjecture goes, we don't know how to solve this problem in a reasonable amount of time, especially as the instance grows large. In this case, the number of ads per advertiser can go on the order of thousands, and, because we can do many combinations of these ad extensions, the number of ads that show up to an auction in the worst case can also be on the order of thousands.</p> <p>One more practical constraint for showing these ads is that we cannot do anything worse than \\(n \\cdot \\log(n)\\). A polynomial n-fourth \\(O(n^4)\\) algorithm is not practical, because whenever you go to\u00a0Google.com, we need return the result at the worst in 200 milliseconds. That is including the time to retrieve old ads from various systems and run the auction. So, the auction itself gets less than 10 milliseconds to run.</p> <p>In other words, this problem is theoretically and practically hard to solve. So, how should we solve this problem?</p> <p>Let's take a little diversion and consider a simpler problem: the Knapsack Problem.</p> <p>The Knapsack Problem</p> <ul> <li>You have a snack budget and you are going on a road trip.</li> <li>You go to a convenience store and you want to buy as many snacks as possible. - Each snack has some value (how happy it makes you).</li> <li>There is a cost for purchasing each snack.</li> </ul> <p>You want to find a set of snacks that maximize the total value you get for this, subject to the constraint that the total cost of your snacks that you're purchasing is less than your budget, say, $100. This problem is still in NP hard, but over the next few slides, we'll look at a simple algorithm for solving this problem.</p> <p>A problem may be NP-hard, and yet, we still have to solve it because we are building something in real life. This Knapsack Problem needs to be solved, and an approach is to use an approximation algorithm.</p> <p>What is approximation algorithm? It is a heuristic/an algorithm that gives us a solution that might not be optimal, but that we can accept if we can prove some approximation guarantee, such as that we will get at least half of the best solution possible. That is a really good guarantee to have because, no matter what instance shows up tomorrow, you're at least getting a reasonable amount of value. Of course, the closer we can make this approximation to \\(1\\), the better, but sometimes it is not possible.</p> <p>Theorem: We can solve the Knapsack Problem in polynomial time to obtain a 2-approximation, i.e. \\(Value(ALG) \\geq \\frac{Value(OPT)}{2}\\).</p> <p>Knapsack Approximation Algorithm</p> <ol> <li>Sort items in the bang-per-buck = value/cost order.</li> <li>Select items until knapsack is almost full (i.e. the next item will overflow).</li> <li>Consider the last item by itself.</li> <li>Pick the higher of steps 2 and 3.</li> </ol> <p>The algorithm is very simple. It basically sorts the items by bang-per-buck: you're not just going to greedily pick by value, but instead, take the ratio of the value and cost, and pick in that order. We'll keep doing this until the knapsack is almost full, and once the next item cannot fit in the bag anymore, it will overflow. We will consider this last item by itself, and we are going to pick the better of this bang-per-buck order, or this last item by itself.</p> <p>Note that Step 3 here is required because sometimes there might be a single item, that is very large but doesn't have a good bang-for-buck (i.e. a very large item with a very high value), and we want to make sure we don't miss it.</p> <p>Let's look at an example.</p> <p>Example: Knapsack Approximation</p> <p>We have \\(3\\) items and the knapsack capacity is \\(2\\):</p> Value Cost Bang-per-buck 18 1 18 21 1.2 17.5 30 2 15 <p>The optimal solution in this case is to pick the last item which has a lot of value.</p> <p>What does the algorithm do?</p> <ul> <li>It considers the ratio of value divided by cost, which is the order the item are shown here.</li> <li>It adds the items one at a time until the knapsack is full. It turns out that we have to stop just after the first item, because the next item would overflow the knapsack.</li> <li>It considers that last item by itself, which is the \\((21, 1.2)\\) item.</li> <li>It picks whichever is the highest, i.e. the \\((21, 1.2)\\).</li> </ul> <p>We see that \\(21 \\geq \\frac{30}{2}\\), to this result satisfies our guarantee of achieving half of the optimal solution.</p> <p>How can we prove that this algorithm is actually a good one? We can capture what the optimal solution looks like\u2014we are not going to solve it, but we can mathematically represent it using an integer program.</p> <p>2-Approximation of The Knapsack Problem</p> <p>Let \\(v_i\\) be the value of item \\(i\\), \\(c_i\\) be the cost of item \\(i\\), and \\(x_i\\) denote whether we selected item \\(i\\) or not.</p> <p>We want to maximize our value, which is \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{items} v_i \\cdot x_i\\).</p> <p>We also know that the sume of the costs of the items cannot exceed our budget \\(B\\), so \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{items} c_i \\cdot x_i \\leq B\\).</p> <p>In addition, any item can only be selected at most once, and we cannot select fractional items in the original problem, but we can relax it into a linear program, such that \\(0 \\leq x_i \\leq 1\\).</p> <p>This program selects all items with \\(\\frac{v_i}{c_i} \\geq \\lambda\\) for some \\(\\lambda \\geq 0\\), and only the last item is added fractionally.</p> <p>We see that:</p> <p>\\(Value(ALG)\\)</p> <p>\\(= max \\; \\{Value(bang \\text{-} for \\text{-} buck \\; solution), Value(last \\; item)\\} \\)</p> <p>\\(\\geq \\frac{Value(bang \\text{-} for \\text{-} buck \\; solution) + Value(last \\; item)}{2}\\)</p> <p>\\(\\geq \\frac{Value(linear \\; program)}{2}\\)</p> <p>\\(\\geq \\frac{Value(OPT)}{2}\\)</p> <p>*Note: Linear programs in general can be solved in polynomial time, so we can solve them pretty fast, even though they might give us a fractional result. However, for proving approximation guarantees for these algorithms we should always use them. They can be a good tool for being able to reason about what the optimal solution looks like, and thinking about how we can approach it.</p> <p>So, that was for the Knapsack Problem, but the rich ad problem is a bit more complicated: it is Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem. In addition to the knapsack constraint of packing these ads, we also have the constraint that we are only allowed to choose one ad per advertiser.</p> <p>There is in fact a similar result, which comes from Sinha and Zoltners's paper from 1978, where they again characterize the optimal solution for the linear program. It does allocation using incremental bang-for-buck, and then they can show that that kind of algorithm will give you a 2-approximation.</p> <p>Theorem: Sinha, Zoltners '78</p> <p>We can optimize social welfare within a factor of \\(2\\), i.e. \\(Value(ALG) \\geq \\frac{Value(OPT)}{2}\\).</p> <p>Key takeaway: We cannot solve the Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem optimally.</p> <p>Can we solve the Rich Ad Auction problem with VCG?</p> <p>Recall that VCG solves the same optimization problem many times. First, it solves the optimization problem to find the best set of ads to show, and then, for each of the ads that you have selected, it solves the optimization problem one more time without this advertiser to calculate the payment. In other words, VCG requires us to solve the same optimization problem again and again. However, as we have seen, this particular optimization problem is hard to solve. Therefore, we cannot use to solve the Rich Ad Auction problem.</p> <p>One of the lessons from reality is that advertisers are strategic along many different domains, rather than a single paramter. For instance, advertisers can be strategic about which ads they give to us to show, especially if it helps them.</p> <p>Suppose an advertiser has a small, a medium and a large ad, but for whatever reason, they say I don't have the medium ad anymore; so we can either show the small ad or the large ad, and if that can somehow give them a better outcome, maybe the large and gets shown. Thus, they get a lot more space by withholding the medium ad than by providing it to us, and that is also something we want to guard against.</p> <p>Example: Is there a way for the advertiser that owns the \\(21\\) and the \\(70\\) value ads to force the auctioneer to choose the outcome on the right?</p> <p></p> <p>If the advertiser just removes the small ad, then the auctioneer will be forced to choose between the other two ads and the one large ad, and they will actually choose the one larger. This is the simplest example where we can start seeing that this strategic dimension of which ads to provide starts to matter.</p> <p>Generally, the more the advertiser gives us, the more flexibility for us to make the best use of their assets to show to the user. So, we want to incentivize advertisers to give us as many assets as possible. If we are running an auction that incentivizes advertisers to remove some of their assets because they are hurting some other assets that are more promising than that, that is bad auction design. This is another reason why truthfulness matters.</p> <p>One of the tricks we can use to solve the Rich Ad Auction problem is to leverage Myerson's Lemma.</p> <p>Myerson's Lemma</p> <p>If we can design allocation rules that are monotone over the values \\(v_i\\), and the advertisers provide a set of ads \\(A_i\\), we can design payment rules that will make the auction truthful.</p> <p>Note that neither the integer optimization algorithm and nor the Sinha-Zoltner'76 algorithm are monotone over a set of rich ads. So, is there a monotone algorithm to solve this problem?</p> <p>Lemma: Allocating in bang-per-buck order is monotone. </p> <p>Allocating in bang-per-buck order is independent of which ads are present, so doesn't change based on the subset of ads.</p> <p>We can find another approximation algorithm for the Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem, which uses randomization to preserve monotonicity.</p> <p>Theorem</p> <p>The following randomized monotone algorithm that allocates in bang-per-buck order with probability \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), and otherwise picks the single highest-value ad, provides a 3-approximation to the fractional optimal solution and is monotone.</p> <p>Rich Ad Auctions Recap</p> <ul> <li>New auctions with different layouts of ads create computational challenges.</li> <li>Advertisers have time to be strategic about which assets to provide, which creates a new strategic dimension to consider.</li> <li>In practice, we rely on more involved heuristics used to get as close to optimal as possible.</li> </ul> <p>Some research papers on this topic:</p> <ul> <li>Aggarwal et al.

LLMs in general can hallucinate (they might make up things), and RAG has been a way to make sure that they are grounded.</p> <p></p> <p>RAG usually works by retrieving a bunch of documents, such as web pages, and then asking the LLM to summarize those documents instead of outputting something from its memory. In that way, it stays true to the ground sources and answers the user's queries.</p> <p>You can see this in action when you go to\u00a0Google.com Nowadays, you get this AI overview, which generates a summary of some of the top results that is generated using RAG.</p> <p></p> <p>Can we do the same with ads? Can we take the advertisers' assets and their bids, and let the LLM generate an ad summary that tells the user what the best products are for whatever they are searching for?</p> <p>It is more complicated because we want the advertiser to be able to specify how much they value being shown to the user. So, they will use their bids to influence how much space they are given  or how their content is presented. We also want use payments to make sure that advertisers are incentivized to report their true value for being shown to the user.</p> <p></p> <p>Can't we just let the LLM do it all, i.e. take the advertisers bids, figure out who gets how much space, and how much to charge them?</p> <p>That is actually hard:</p> <ul> <li>We don't know how to do this.</li> <li>LLMs are neither interpretable nor controllable, and there are alignment issues (we cannot make sure that they are staying true to the best way of presenting the information to the user).</li> <li>LLMs cannot provide good monotonicity guarantees or incentive guarantees to the auctioneer.</li> </ul> <p>Instead, we generalize position auctions and rich ad auctions, to design auctions with large language models: this is called the Factorized Auction Model.</p> <p></p> <p>We are factorizing the auction: modules are divided into different parts, where each part will be easier to understand, so we can make sure we can provide good guarantees for it.</p> <p>There is:</p> <ul> <li>An auction module that takes the bids from the advertisers and decides who gets how much space, and then also decide to what prices they should be charged.</li> <li>An LLM module that takes this space considerations, and adds the description and URL of the ad to content from the advertisers' website, and then generates the summary.</li> <li>A feedback loop in the form of click-through rate, where we learn from showing these ads to the user how they are liking it, how much prominence is useful for a given advertiser, and feed that back for running their auctions.</li> </ul> <p>The nice thing about breaking everything up into pieces is:</p> <ul> <li>The auction part is a classic auction: it maps the bids and visitors to prominences, which is just a scalar number, and it also calculates CPCs (Cost Per Clicks).

Then, the auction can be optimized separately to come up with good mapping of bids to prominences.</p> <p>As mentioned, we can provide incentive compatibility and welfare maximization guarantees. That requires knowing about how the prominences will map through click-through rates, because the social welfare cares about click-through rate (and not so much about prominence). However, if the factors have some specific format, like we assumed earlier\u2014there is a advertiser component, a condition component, a prominence component\u2014it is reasonable to assume that that is a concave function. So, as you get more and more space, you are not able to get more value it: maybe it is like a polynomial-exponential function of some sort prominence raised to \\(\\beta\\).</p> <p>Optimization with Continuous Ads</p> <p>Factorized CTR model:</p> <p>\\(pctr_i^{final} = pctr_i \\cdot pos_norm_i \\cdot f(Prom_i)\\)</p> <p>where</p> <p>\\(f(Prom_i) = Prom_i^{\\beta} \\; for \\beta \\in (0,1]\\).</p> <p>If it is this format, or a general concave format with nice differentiability, we can actually obtain a closed-form solution for what is the right way to allocate these ads.</p> <p>Case Study: Dynamic Word-length Summary</p> <p>Auction component: Generalized Proportional Allocation (GPA), where the relative prominence is proportional to the power of:</p> <p>\\(ecpm \\approx bid \\cdot base \\_ pctr \\cdot position \\_ normalizer\\).</p> <p>The formula is simple: we just give each ad a location that is proportional to their eCPM, which is the bid times the pCTR and a position optimizer.

Break ties arbitrarily.</p> <p>How can we reason about whether this first idea is a good idea or not? We measure the success of online learning algorithms in terms of regret. Our benchmark is a fixed action over time: we are comparing with the best stock overall, not the best stock every single day.

So, in any algorithm based on history, the next choice is going to be a random coin flip.</p> <p>However, if we have \\(n\\) actions, one of them is going to do a little bit better than average (each one has a \\(50/50\\) expectation, but one of them is going to be a little bit better than average). If we do the math of how much better than average it is going to be, it comes out to roughly this magic number of \\(O(\\sqrt{T \\log(n)})\\).</p> <p>The number \\(O(\\sqrt{T \\log(n)})\\) itself is not super important.

Indeed, another benchmark we can use is the best action each day (rather than the best action overall). The benchmark is just too high. For instance, if everyday we are playing a game where we flip a coin, and we need to determine whether it is going to be head or tail, there is no good algorithm for this, it is helpless.</p> <p>We saw that, for external regret, there is an algorithm that can do as well as the best stock, even with adversarial input.

We are assuming that Marvin believes that Harry will actually play Grim Trigger (we will see later why this is a possible assumption).

This is why the payoff is basically \\(2 \\cdot the \\; geometric \\; sequence \\; for \\; (1-p)\\), which comes down to \\(2/p\\). In other words, if Marvin always uploads, his expected utility is \\(2/p\\).</p> <p>Never Uploading: If Marvin never uploads, in the first iteration, Harry uploads, and then Harry sees that Marvin did not upload, so he is never going to upload again. The payoff for Marvin is \\(3\\) for the first day, and \\(0\\) for the rest of time, meaning that his utility is \\(3\\).</p> <p>Conclusion: To decide whether he should always upload or never upload, Marvin should ask when \\(3\\) is greater than \\(2/p\\), which means that he should always upload when \\(p \\leq \\frac{2}{3}\\).</p> <p>If Harry is playing the Grim Trigger strategy, then it makes sense for Marvin to always upload whenever \\(p \\leq \\frac{2}{3}\\). So, if the game ends every day with probability \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), then it makes sense for both Harry and Marvin to always upload, which is why this is an SPE.</p> <p>Question: We saw earlier that for any number of iteration \\(n\\), both players should play the strategy of never uploading. How could it be that it makes sense for Marvin to always upload whenever \\(p \\leq \\frac{2}{3}\\), if for any \\(n\\), the SPE is to never upload?</p> <p>The point is that, in the random-stopping game, the players do not know in advance when the game is going to end, so any day, they are still doing the same calculations that we just did (on day \\(7\\), it is still the same as on day \\(1\\)), which is why there is always an incentive to upload and make their future better, because they don\u2019t know when the future terminates. However, when we analyze the SPE with \\(n\\) days, we know when the last day is, so we can determine when there is no point uploading (because there is no future).</p> <p>Theorem: Folk Theorem (Game Strategy)</p> <p>If the players are patient enough, then repeated interaction can result in virtually any average payoff in an SPE equilibrium.</p> <p>In other words, the Folk theorem gives general conditions on when Harry can incentivize Marvin to play certain actions (e.g., uploading) using threats like the Grim Trigger strategy.</p> <p>On issue with the Grim Trigger strategy is that, if for some reason, Marvin's connection goes down one day and he cannot upload, then Harry will never upload again, and Marvin in turn will not upload again, so they get stuck with a utilit of \\(0\\) until the end of the game.</p> <p>A more practical, robust alternative to the Grim Trigger strategy is called the Tit-for-Tat strategy.</p> <p>Definition: The Tit-for-Tat Strategy</p> <ul> <li>In stage \\(1\\), upload.</li> <li>In stage \\(i\\), reproduce the action of the other player on stage \\(i-1\\).</li> </ul> <p>Analysis: Marvin's Choices When Playing Tit-for-Tat</p> Upload Free-ride Upload (2,2) (-1,3) Free-ride (3,-1) (0,0) <p>At stage \\(i\\), Marvin can:</p> <ul> <li>Upload on stage \\(i\\) (utility of \\(-1\\)), and then download on stage \\(i+1\\) (utility of \\(+3\\)) with probability \\((1-p)\\), because there is the probability that there is no next day.</li> <li>Not upload on stage \\(i\\) (utility of \\(0\\)), and then not download on stage \\(i+1\\) (utility of \\(0\\)).</li> </ul> <p>Conclusion: To decide whether he should always upload or never upload, Marvin should ask when \\(-1 + 3 \\cdot (1-p) \\geq 0\\), which means that he should always upload whenever \\(p \\leq \\frac{2}{3}\\).</p> <p>Notes:</p> <ul> <li>The conclusion is the same for Tit-for-Tat as for Grim Trigger, but this is a coincidence: in general, Grim Trigger is a stronger threat.</li> <li>When \\(p = \\frac{2}{3}\\), then both \u201calways upload\u201d \u201cnever upload\u201d are strategic.</li> </ul> <p>Iterated File-Sharing Dilemma Recap</p> <ol> <li>In a one-shot game, free-riding is a strictly dominant strategy, i.e. for any action Marvin takes, Harry is always better of not uploading.</li> <li>With any fixed number of iterations, free-riding is the SPE.</li> <li>With a random number of iterations, a credible threat of future retaliation can lead to cooperation.</li> </ol> <p>In practice, game theory predicts that:</p> <ol> <li>Players do not cooperate in one-round games.</li> <li>Players do not cooperate in \\(n\\)-round games.</li> <li>Players likely cooperate in games with a random number of rounds.</li> </ol> <p>In fact, in the real world, we frequently observe \\((1)\\) and \\((3)\\): in tourist traps, restaurants they might as well charge customers as much as they can, because they will only see them once, while in locals\u2019 favorite spots, restaurants expect customers to come over and over, so they have incentives to serve them well.</p> <p>What about \\((2)\\)?</p> <p>Experiment: Axelrod Games</p> <p>Around 1980, Professor Robert Axelrod invited friends to write computer programs for a tournament of iterated file-sharing dilemma with a fixed number of round \\(n = 200\\).</p> <p>Out of 15 submissions, Tit-for-Tat won first place.</p> <p>Notes:</p> <ul> <li>Tit-for-Tat can never win a head-to-head match, but encouraging cooperating leads to a higher score on average.</li> <li>You can always do better than Tit-for-Tat: you can play Tit-for-Tat during \\(199\\) rounds, and not upload in the last round, but in practice, no participant tried this strategy.</li> </ul> <p>Later on, Professor Axelrod invited his friends to play again.

If we can have a good kidney with \\(50\\%\\) or an okay match with \\(70\\%\\) (more likely), we can use expectation to compare those options, while with cardinal utilitie alone, comparison is more challenging.</p> <p>Finally, let's note that we typically quantify cardinal utilities with money, which is good in some applications, but problematic in some other applications. There are alternatives, such as \u201cquality-adjusted life years\u201d in health economics, which measure how many additional years a patient may live with a kidney. It is not perfect either, but it is some way to help us make these decisions.</p> <p>In other applications, where money is not a good idea, it is not clear what the right measure is. For instance, how do we quantify utility in education (e.g. how much utility do we get from taking CS269I?\u2014a lot, for sure, but how much?) or in dating apps (e.g. how do we quantify how we are making better matches?)</p> <p>In contrast, one disadvantage of cardinal utilities is that humans are better at comparing outcomes.</p> <p>Introducing money changes market dynamics substantially:</p> <ul> <li>Stanford housing would differ if rooms were auctioned.</li> <li>Buying organs is illegal in most countries.</li> <li>Hospitals-student monetary matches face legal restrictions.</li> </ul> <p>However, there are also some challenges in non-monetary transfers:</p> <ul> <li>Without monetary transfers, we are limited to ordinal preferences.</li> <li>When we force non-monetary transfers, people try to get their way under the table, which comes with legal issues (admissions scandal) and risks (illegal organ transplants, for both people who buy and sell organs)</li> <li>We need a permission systems (as opposed to a permission-less system, such as the Internet or Bitcoin), otherwise,<ul> <li>For instance in the Stanford housing lottery, you need a SUNet ID, so that applicants do not enter the draw with a bot and get a million lottery tickets.</li> <li>With online reviews, we really have a problem with restaurants writing really good reviews for themselves and bad reviews for competing restaurants.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Definition: Fungible Goods vs Idiosyncratic Goods</p> <ul> <li>Fungible goods: Interchangeable units.</li> <li>Idiosyncratic goods: Unique goods.</li> </ul> <p>In other words, goods are fungible when there lots of interchangeable copies of an item, such as copies of a new book. In contrast, goods idiosyncratic when they have intrinsic features. If you try to buy a house, every house is very different from the house down the street (problems with the roof, nicer garden, better location, etc.), so we need to understand the value of each house. In dating apps, it is similar: each person is very different. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) by definition are idiosyncratic.</p> <p>In practice, many things are a mix of fungible and idiosyncratic. For instance, in a ride-sharing app, we don\u2019t really care who the driver is (the driver is fungible), but we really care where we go (the destination is idiosyncratic).</p>"},{"location":"lecture-6/#supply-and-demand-of-fungible-goods","title":"Supply and Demand of Fungible Goods","text":"<p>Definition: Demand Curve</p> <p>Consider a perfectly fungible good, e.g., copies of a book:</p> <ul> <li>1 buyer is willing to pay $10 for the book.</li> <li>2 additional buyers are willing to pay $9 for the book.</li> <li>1 addition buyer is willing ti pay $8 for the book.</li> <li>Etc.</li> </ul> <p>We can plot this aggregate demand curve, which is typically decreasing, as more buyers are interested when the price is lower:</p> <p></p> <p>Note: The demand curve represents how many buyers are willing to buy at each price.

Producers only expand output when price at least covers that rising marginal cost.</li> <li>For a pure digital good\u2014software, an e\u2011book, a music file\u2014the marginal cost of copying and distributing one more unit is essentially zero, so a seller is already willing to supply any quantity at any price just above zero.\u00a0Raising the price therefore doesn\u2019t unlock extra output the way it does for physical goods. Instead, the constraint is usually legal (who owns the copyright) or strategic (how the seller wants to segment the market), not technological cost.</li> </ul> <p>In the short run the supply curve is therefore flat (perfectly elastic) at roughly zero cost, and in the long run depends on covering the fixed cost of creating the first copy rather than on the per\u2011unit price, so the classic Law of Supply tied to marginal production cost doesn\u2019t bite.</p> <p>Definition: Market Clearing Price</p> <p>The price where demand and supply curves meet is called the market clearing price or market equilibrium.</p> <p></p> <p>The vanilla assumption in classical economics is that buyers and sellers should naturally converge to the special price \\(p^\\star\\), where the supply meets the demand. At market clearing price, the numbers of interested buyers and sellers are equal, so they can all transact (i.e. \"clear the market\").</p> <p>This is not complicated but super important. The reason we call this an equilibrium is because:</p> <ul> <li>At that price, all the buyers who want to buy for that price can buy exactly from all the sellers who want to sell at that price (the supply is exactly meeting the demand).</li> <li>There are some sellers who are willing to sell at a higher price, but they stay out of it.</li> <li>There are some buyers who are willing to buy at a lower price, but they stay out of it.</li> </ul> <p>We are trying to think of a single price that works for the entire market.

If a buyer is not matched, that means that they don\u2019t want any good. This means that the utility for every good is negative (the value minus what it would cost them is negative). So, they stay unmatched (they have the option to remain unmatched).</p> <p>This is an important concept called individual rationality: no agent is strictly less happy after participating in the mechanism. In other words, every buyer is no worse after transacting than they were before.

What if everyone wants the same good?</p> <p>The intuition to manage this is through prices, because if a good is over-demanded, we increase the price, until buyers leave it.</p> <p>Question 2: What if there are two buyers with the exact same utility?</p> <p>Because we have a weak inequality (rather than a strict inequality), it means that every buyer is matched until they do not have another good that they prefer, so if two buyers have the same utility, we can increase the price until they are indifferent between two rooms, and then we can give either room to either buyer and they will both be happy.</p> <p>Question 3: What if there are two people who are willing to pay $6B for the same room?</p> <p>We increase the price to \\(\\$6\\)B, and at that point, they are indifferent between getting the room for \\(\\$6\\)B and not getting any room (or getting another cheap room), so we can tie-break arbitrarily and give the room to one of them.</p> <p>Question 4: Does buying the room provide additional utility, such as the satisfaction of winning the auction and showing off? We are not modeling this here. It is just that every buyer has some value for each good, but they do not care about what everyone else is getting.</p> <p>Why is a competitive equilibrium an equilibrium?</p> <p>Reminder: In a competitive equilibrium:</p> <ol> <li>Each buyer is matched to their favorit good (given prices) or no good if they don't want any.</li> <li>If no buyer is matched to good \\(j\\), then \\(p_j = 0\\).</li> </ol> <p>Therefore:</p> <ul> <li>By \\((1)\\), no buyer wants to deviate to a different room, they are given their favorite room given the prices.</li> <li>No good is over-demanded (we are matching each buyer to a room, but we are not matching two buyers to the same room), so no there is no pressure to increase prices.</li> <li>By \\((2)\\), under-demanded goods are priced at \\(0\\), so we can't decrease their price lower any more.</li> </ul> <p>Important Note</p> <p>Aviad pointed out a notion that is always confusing for students: A competitive equilibrium is the combination of prices and the assignment of guests to rooms together (all of that constitute the equilibrium, not just one or the other).</p> <p>The last condition essentially says that there is always an empty room that is priced at \\(0\\). Buyers compare all available rooms at their respective prices, but they also compare those with the option of not getting a room and not paying any price (staying in a tent for instance).</p> <p>Question: What about seller\u2019s utility?</p> <p>This already captures seller\u2019s utility. What this does not capture is production cost. This definition makes sense if we assume that sellers have \\(0\\) cost, which we will pretend for now, which in practice is not true but we will hide it to keep things simpler.</p> <p>Question: Why if no buyer is matched to a good, then the price is 0?</p> <p>If a good is unpopular and no one wants it, we don\u2019t know if it is because it is priced too high, or because it is bad (e.g. a room in a bad neighborhood).

However, there are ways to get around it: - Thick(er) market: As a market becomes very thick (it is far from a monopoly), then it approaches seller-strategy proof.

There was a lot of uncertainty, it was hard to tell whether doctors were a good match, yet because of uncertainty, hospitals were sending offers too early.</p> <p>However, now, with the centralized system, offers are sent during the final year of study, so doctors know better what they want.</p> <p>Timing Issue #2: Exploding Offers</p> <p>An exploding offer is like a job offer that requires a very short response.</p> <p>One reason why one wants to give exploding offers is that, if a job offer is turned down, an employer needs to scramble to find someone else to fill the position.</p> <p>This type of constraint is amplified when:</p> <ul> <li>There is a limited time window for making offers, since you don\u2019t have more time to turn around.</li> <li>An employer is constrained to only hire exactly one person. If you hire 10 people, you can make 20 offers, but if you hire 1 person, you need to know very fast if they are going to accept the offer or not, so you put the pressure on the candidate.</li> </ul> <p>The de Gea transfer</p> <ul> <li>24 hours is a short time window to make a goalie transfer decision worth millions of euros.</li> <li>The reason of this is that FIFA has a limited time window for when you are allowed to transfer soccer players.</li> <li>Each team has exactly one starting goalie, so they cannot make offers to three goalies (they don\u2019t want to have 2 and they don\u2019t want to have 0).</li> </ul> <p>Note: David de Gea's transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United in 2015 failed due to administrative issues, specifically the late submission of paperwork.

For instance, selling health insurance to college students is probably a good deal (they are younger and in better health than the average person).</p> <p>If companies can sell health insurance targeted at healthier individuals/demographics, then competitors are left with less healthy people who may be more expensive to insure, which drives the prices up.</p> <p>However, healthy people do not want to buy health insurance when the prices are high, only people who have higher health costs are going to buy when prices are high.</p> <p>That means that health insurance companies have to raise their prices even more.

At these auctions, the government buys some frequencies back from TV stations that don\u2019t need as much any more, and sells them to cell phone companies. Auctions help set the price.</li> <li>If you have a nice product, such as a family heirloom, we may have no idea how much it should cost. An auction (such as eBay) helps discover the price.</li> <li>Products with specific attributes, such as ads. There is a search engine, and a user searching for pizza, at a specific time, in a specific town, so it is a very specific case, and we don\u2019t know exactly how much it is worth to pizzerias next to this user. Ad auctions help determine the price.</li> </ul> <p>When the buyers have the computational power and the patience to bid:</p> <ul> <li>When we we are selling something very expensive, auctions may be a good idea. For instance, in the wireless spectrum auctions, in 2021, the government auctioned $80 billion worth of spectrum, and the whole auction process took 3 months. The TV stations and cell phone companies were willing to spend this time to figure out exactly how to bid and participate in this long process, which makes sense since it is a very expensive product.</li> <li>Ad auctions are also a popular mechanism. These are super fast (split of a second): when you search something, by the time you get the result, there is already an auction happening behind the scenes.

The regret is the sum, over time, of the difference between the reward of the overall best action and the reward from my algorithm.</p> <p>If we use a regret-minimization algorithm, we expect this regret to approach or approximately approach zero. In a candidate coarse correlated equilibrium CCE:</p> <ul> <li>Draw \\(t\\) at random.</li> <li>The signal is \\(ALG(t)\\).</li> </ul> <p>So, each player is getting the action they took on day \\(t\\). Therefore, the expected utility from following the signal is the sum of the rewards the actual algorithm got. The utility from ignoring the signal is the sum of the rewards the best action got. The regret going to zero means that following the signal is almost as good as ignoring the signal and playing the overall best action.</p> <p>How does swap-regret converge to correlated equilibrium?</p> <p>Reminder: the definition of correlated equilibrium is that I am looking at the signal, and still after seeing the signal, I cannot do better than the signal. Swap-regret is harder to minimize, but if you get to minimize, it is better.</p> <p>Can we talk about Myerson\u2019s theorem?</p> <p>Here is what Myerson\u2019s theorem is saying:</p> <ul> <li>The first part is just that we have an auction selling one item to one buyer. In this case, how should we sell one item to one buyer? We can set the reserve price and ask the buyer if they want to buy the item for the price or not. The Myerson\u2019s theorem also gives us a formula to calculate the best price, by looking at the area under the curve.</li> <li>The second part says that this is the best way to sell one item. It is not trivial but it is true: you can do a lot of complicated things, but none of this helps, you might as well just set one price.</li> <li>The third part says that if we have some fixed number of buyers \\(n\\), and we don\u2019t know their values, but we assume that they are iid, they come from the same distribution \\(D\\). It turns out that the revenue-optimal auction to sell one item to these \\(n\\) buyers it to do a second-price with reserve price \\(p(D)\\) auction (where the reserve price is the same whether we have \\(1\\) buyer or \\(100\\) buyers).</li> </ul> <p>Reminder: in a second-price auction, everyone submits their sealed bid, but to win the auction, you don\u2019t need to only beat everyone else, but also the reserve price, and then you pay the maximum of everyone else and the reserve price.</p> <p>As the competition increases, it becomes more likely that we have two buyers whose value exceed the reserve price, and as soon as that happens, we don\u2019t need the reserve price anymore, because to win the auction, we don\u2019t need to beat the reserve price, we need to beat the second highest bid.</p> <p>If the reserve price becomes irrelevant as the number of bidders increases, and the revenue equivalence holds, why is the second price auction revenue optimal and not also the first price auction?</p> <p>As competition increases, it does not matter whether we are doing second-price or first-price, because we are reaching this point where the market is setting the price. The advantage of second-price auction is that it is strategyproof, so it is easier to analyze, while first price auction is not.</p> <p>The revenue equivalence theorem says that the different types of auctions are all going to get the same revenue, but it is assuming that we are always giving the good to the buyer with the maximum value and there are two complications here:</p> <ul> <li>When we have a reserve price, maybe we do not give the item at all.</li> <li>First-price auction is not truthful bidding, so buyers are going to shade their bid in a possibly-mixed strategy way, which makes it harder to keep track of who is going to get the item, but (Aviad thinks that) it is still true that if we run first-price with reserve price and the distribution of values is continuous, first-price and second-price are going to make the same allocation and they will get the same revenue.</li> </ul> <p>Why does the Bulow-Klemperer theorem hold?</p> <p>This theorem says that the revenue of second price with n+1 buyers is at least as great as the revenue of second price with reserve price with n buyers. We can imagine two cases:</p> <ul> <li>One case when it is n+1 real buyers: the seller always makes money.</li> <li>Another case when it is n buyers and the seller that set the reserve price: sometimes, the seller does not make money (because the reserve price is not beat, and the seller keeps the item).</li> </ul> <p>Why is it a dangerous practice to learn the reserve price from historical bids?</p> <p>Let\u2019s say that you are bidding to display ads on my website, and you know that next year I am going to set the reserve price based on what you do this year: what would you this year? You are going to start shading your bids this year, and I have no idea about what your real value is.

So, the ask becomes \\(\\$2\\).</li> <li>The buyer who previous bought the contract for \\(\\$3\\) would have been better off trading with this new seller, but when they placed their buy order for \\(\\$4\\), the seller with the ask order of \\(\\$2\\) was not there, so they traded with the seller with the ask order of \\(\\$3\\).</li> <li>After we clear out all the orders that can trade with each other, the ask is higher than the bid, and the difference is called the spread.</li> </ul> <p>There are two kinds of orders in this book:</p> <ul> <li>Marketable orders: We already have a match in the book, so they can transact immediately, e.g., a buyer places a buy order for \\(\\$4\\) when there is already a sell order for \\(\\$3\\) on the market.</li> <li>Resting (non-marketable) orders: We are waiting to match , e.g., a buyer places a buy order for \\(\\$1\\), but there is no sell order at all in the book, so it is resting in the book.</li> </ul> <p>Note: This is not very complicated, but these are a very useful definitions (which will come back later in the quarter).</p> <p>Example of Prediction Market: Iowa Electronic Market (IEM) (Cont'd)</p> <p>All predictors have D-contracts and R-contracts. They look at the order book, and they see that R-contracts are trading for \\(\\$0.60\\). If they think that there is less than a 60% probability that the Republican candidate is going to win, they should sell their R-contracts or buy more D-contracts.</p> <p>There are some legal issues with prediction markets in the US (and beyond):</p> <ul> <li>Trading in prediction markets is essentially gambling, which is mostly illegal in the US, except in Las Vegas, Nevada.</li> <li>IEM was granted an exception (\"no action letter\") by the CFTC, but it is limited to 1,000 traders and \\(\\$500\\) per trader (i.e. no one person can dominate the market.)</li> <li>Intrade operated from Ireland for a while but was shut down in 2012 by the CFTC.</li> <li>PredictIt, which is also operated by a university since 2014, namely Victoria University of Wellington, and has a similar status to IEM. The CFTC ordered it to shut down in 2022/2023, but PredictIt sued and won, so it is still operating.</li> <li>Some decentralized prediction markets exist, such as AUgur and Polymarket, but they are probably illegal to use for US residents.</li> </ul> <p>Interestingly, meanwhile on Wall St, we can legally buy \"naked shorts\" for billions of dollars:</p> <ul> <li>A short is when someone believes a stock is going to go down, so they borrow some shares of it, and sell them immediately, with the intention of buying them back after the price has gone down.</li> <li>A \"naked short\" is when someone sells some shares of stock without first borrowing them (or without ensuring that they can be borrowed). This is done in the hopes that the price of the stock will fall, allowing the seller to buy back the shares at a lower price and profit from the difference. Important Note: It is a type of securities fraud.</li> </ul> <p>Example of Prediction Market: Iowa Electronic Market (IEM) (Cont'd)</p> <p>Given the rules of the market, we can interpret the price as a probability, aggregating the market's beliefs:</p> <p></p> <p>In theory (assuming the \\(\\$500\\)-per-trader restriction), at equilibrium prices \\((p_D, p_R)\\): \\(Number \\; of \\; D-contracts = Number \\; of \\; D-contracts\\).</p> <p>In other words: The total budget of the predictors who think that the Democratic candidate has a probability of winning greater than \\(p_D\\), divided by \\(p_D\\), is equal to the total budget of the predictors who think that the Republican candidate has a probability of winning greater than \\(p_R\\), divided by \\(p_R\\).</p> <p>Although this has a sense of aggregate probability, it tends to be skewed towards making the seem a little more balanced than it really is, because each time we are dividing the total budget by the price per contract. So, if the price per contract is small (e.g., this is the contract for the underdog, i.e. the candidate least likely to win), then we are dividing by a smaller number, so we are giving it a higher weight. </p>"},{"location":"lecture-9/#liquidity-and-no-trade-theorems","title":"Liquidity and No-Trade Theorems","text":"<p>In prediction markets, if there is a large spread, it reveals poor information aggregation.</p> <p>Example of Large Spread: Will Lebron James Sign With The Chicago Bulls?</p> <p>The bid for Yes was \\(5\\%\\), while the ask ask for No was almost \\(40\\%\\).

In other words, liquidity providers leave bid/ask resting orders on the book.</p> <p>Other investors can buy/sell at any time by trading with liquity providers.

So, if Alice wants to buy at the current price, she must know something that Bob doesn't know. However, if Alice wants to buy (from Bob), then Bob does not want to sell (to Alice). Thus, even if Alice has some private information, she cannot use it, because Bob (i.e. no one) wants to trade with he\u2014because she is too excited to trade based on the public information alone.</p> <p>In prediction markets, if everyone is rational:</p> <ul> <li>No one should be trading.
