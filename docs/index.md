These course notes for Stanford CS269I are based on the content of Aviad Rubinstein's lectures in the Spring 2025 quarter. This site is developed by Thibaud Clement, based on Eric Gao's original course notes from the Winter 2023 quarter.

Computers/algorithms control a lot of economic processes, including online retail, online advertising, algo-trading, cryptocurrencies, etc. There is a need to jointly understand economics and computation to analyze these applications. While relying on an increase of computing power (more GPUs) may be an option to compensate for inefficiencies, some specific cases may actually justify the need for efficient algorithms.
    
When it comes to incentives, leveraging more GPUs is not the solution. Computer scientists often need to build systems that interact with other agents, such as users, algorithms, Large Language Models, and even other systems. It is crucial to consider that these other agents are going to behave selfishly to predict how they are going to interact with the system, and design an implement said accordingly.

CS269I aims to teach students how to think about incentives (through lagnauge, frameworks, and practice), to get familiar with economic theory concepts (i.e. stable matching, proof-of-work, etc.), and analyze case studies to understand potential gaps between theory and practice.
