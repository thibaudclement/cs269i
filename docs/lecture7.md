# Market Failures
(4/21/2025)

Previously, we assumed free markets converge naturally to optimal outcomes. However, markets often fail to achieve optimal outcomes—known as market failures.

## Externalities and Public Goods

**Externalities**: Effects of transactions on third parties not directly involved.

**Public Goods**: Goods accessible to everyone and not owned individually.

Examples:
- Environmental harm from air travel (negative externality).
- WiFi bandwidth overuse (negative externality).

**Solutions:**
1. **Pigouvian Tax**: Tax transactions proportional to the externality they cause.
2. **Coasian Bargaining**: Privatize public goods and let market bargaining reach social efficiency (Coase theorem).

## Transaction Costs

Costs associated with making transactions that prevent beneficial trades.

**Examples:**
- Sales tax blocking a mutually beneficial sale.
- Time/information costs preventing trades (hungry student looking for apples).

Transaction costs can be monetary or non-monetary (time, effort, information).

## Market Thickness

- **Thick Market**: Many buyers/sellers, competitive prices, efficient outcomes.
- **Thin Market**: Few buyers/sellers, monopoly pricing, inefficiencies.

**Why monopolies are problematic:**
- Reduced quantity sold.
- Higher prices.
- Lower consumer surplus.

The first welfare theorem applies with cost-covering reserve prices, but these reserve prices aren't strategyproof:

<div class="proof" markdown="1">
<strong>Proof:</strong>

If reserve prices are nonbinding, sellers can slightly increase them and remain profitable. If binding (equal to cost), sellers earn zero profit, thus increasing prices slightly above cost yields positive profit. This creates a profitable deviation.
</div>

**Ways around this:**
- In large markets, deviations from strategyproofness diminish (strategyproof-in-the-large).
- Limited seller information on buyer valuations restricts strategic price setting.

**Thickening Markets:**
- Encourage participation and retention.
- Merge markets (e.g., larger kidney exchanges).
- Batch transactions to aggregate buyers and sellers.

## Timing Issues

**Market Unraveling:**
- Matches occur prematurely (medical students matched early, creating mismatches over time).

**Exploding Offers:**
- Offers requiring rapid responses due to competitive pressures or regulatory constraints.

**Examples:**
- APPIC psychologist hiring (1970–1990s) faced early and premature matching despite rules.

**Resolving Timing Issues:**
- Centralized matching mechanisms.
- Allow reneging on exploding offers to remove incentives to rush decisions.

## Information Asymmetries

Sellers know more about goods than buyers, causing uncertainty and inefficiency.

**Example: Market for Lemons (used cars)**
- Good and bad cars indistinguishable by buyers.
- Buyers pay less due to uncertainty.
- Good cars leave market; only bad cars remain (adverse selection).

Possible equilibria:
- Bad equilibrium: only lemons sold at low prices.
- Good equilibrium: enough good cars maintain higher average quality and price.

**Other Examples:**
- Health insurance markets (buyer health knowledge).
- Clickbait (creators know content quality; users do not).

**Adverse Selection**: Poor-quality products dominate markets due to asymmetry.

**Solutions:**
- Increase transparency (mandatory disclosure, reputation systems).
- Restrict informational use (universal healthcare, insider trading rules).
- Filter lemons through warranties or guarantees.
